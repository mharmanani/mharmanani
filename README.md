# 👋 Hello, I'm Mohamed

## 🔬 About Me

I am a Doctoral Researcher at the Vector Institute and a PhD student at Queen's University in the Medical Informatics Laboratory. My research focuses on designing, training, and deploying trustworthy deep learning models for disease diagnosis and computer-assisted interventions.

My research interests include:

- 🧠 Deep Learning
- 🩻 Medical Imaging
- 🖼️ Computer Vision
- 💬 Natural Language Processing

Most of my repositories reflect ongoing or completed projects, tools, or experiments related to my PhD work.

## 📚 Research Highlights

### 🔬 Current Projects

- **🧠 Image-Guided Medical Reasoning** – Using large vision-language and reasoning models for interpretable diagnostics in medical imaging.
- **🔄 Multi-Modal Knowledge Transfer** – Learning from diverse data and imaging modalities (e.g., histology, MRI) and transferring knowledge to low-data clinical settings.
- **🎯Attribute Localization and Visual Grounding** – Identifying diagnostically relevant regions in medical images using attention and visual explanations.
